# ML Deploy Pipeline

This repository is the starting point for building an end-to-end automated ML model deployment pipeline.
**The goal**: train a model, track experiments, version artifacts, and prepare for deployment on AWS (via Lambda, Docker, and Terraform), with CI/CD handled through GitHub Actions.
